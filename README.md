# Abstract-Challenge
Challenge made for the Nology Course.

## Instructions:
Your challenge is to create an Abstract Class called "Shape".  
Shape must have two abstract methods called getArea and getPerimeter.  
Shape must have the data attribute numOfSides.
You must create four subclasses called Square, Rectangle, Triangle and Circle that extend the abstract class Shape.
These subclasses will have different amounts of variables associated to them.
Complete the logic so that all four shapes can be instantiated and both methods called on them.  These methods should simply return the value of perimeter and area.

Bonus - Create an array of 50 Shapes.  Random amount of triangles, circles and squares.  All of these shapes should have correct but random arguments passed into them.
